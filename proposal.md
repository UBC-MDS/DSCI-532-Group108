# Proposal for Group 108

## Motivation and Purpose

## Description of the Data
The dataset that we choose to visualize is a public dataset that can be downloaded from the Vancouver Police Department's Open Data: https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/. It is a collection of types, locations, dates and times of crimes occurred in City of Vancouver for the past 16 years.  The earliest date in the dataset is January 1, 2003, and the latest date is October 31, 2019.  
  
This dataset is available to the public and no special permit or registration is required.  As it contains temporal-spatial information of crimes, it can be a great guidance to policy makers for laying out community development plans.  As an individual living in Vancouver like ourselves, it can also serve as a reference for selecting residence.

There are 622,221 crime records in this dataset, and each crime record contains: (`TYPE`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `HUNDRED_BLOCK`, `NEIGHBOURHOOD`, `X`, `Y`) columns . (`TYPE`) specifies 11 types of crimes (â€˜Break and Enter Commercial', 'Break and Enter Residential/Other', 'Homicide', 'Mischief', 'Offence Against a Person', 'Other Theft', 'Theft from Vehicle', 'Theft of Bicycle', 'Theft of Vehicle', 'Vehicle Collision or Pedestrian Struck (with Fatality)', 'Vehicle Collision or Pedestrian Struck (with Injury)'), and (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR` and `MINUTE`) columns specify the date and time when the reported crime occurred.  To indicate the location of the crimes, we have (`HUNDRED_BLOCK` and `NEIGHBORHOOD`).  (`X` and `Y`) provides the coordinates in UTM Zone 10 format and will need to be converted into longitude and latitude if we want to render a map with GeoJSON.
